## Hi, my name is Josh

I'm a software engineer and entrepuener. I also support my maker wife with her business Bad Frog Yarn Co. I handle the business and technical side of things so she can focus on making amazing hand dyed yarn that we sell thru our local stores, yarn festivals, and online.

We currently use Shopify, and it sucks! I've tried for months to get it to work for our needs. But it has too many features we don't need and is lackey some we do need. So obviously that means I have to build my own version of Shopify.

And now MakerBiz will be born.
